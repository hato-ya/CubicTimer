# Smart timer support
## How to connect external smart timer
Tap the Bluetooth icon and the app will scan for Bluetooth devices.
Tap the found device name/address to connect to Smart Timer.

## Supported smart timer
- Gan Smart Timer
- Gan Halo Smart Timer

# Stack timer support
## How to connect external stack timer
Prepare RS232C to USB convert cable (IMPORTANT!! IT IS NOT AUDIO CABLE used by csTimer).
I recommend RS232 3.5mm Audio Jack Serial Adapter Cable used for the Intel Galileo Gen1 board. But the operation is not guaranteed.
Output voltage level of G4 stack timer is lower than the specification of RS232C. Therefore, sometimes there are compatibility problems.

## Supported stack timer
- Speed Stacks Pro Timer G5
- Speed Stacks Pro Timer G4
- Speed Stacks Pro Timer G3 (not confirmed, maybe)
- YuXin Timer V2
- Gan Halo Smart Timer
- QiYi Smart Timer (only via RS232C-USB cable)

## Supported RS232C to USB converter device
It depends on usb-serial-for-android.
I confirmed USB-RS232 cable using FT232R.
